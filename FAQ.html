	<div class='qa'>
	<p class='question'><b>Q: How can I get an update when a new post comes out?</b></p>
	<p><b>A:</b> I post about my new post on this Twitter <a href="https://twitter.com/lilianweng/">@lilianweng</a> account. There is also a <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/feed.xml" target="_blank">RSS feed</a>.</p>
	</div>

	<div class='qa'>
	<p class='question'><b>Q: What tool do you use for plotting?</b></p>
	<p><b>A:</b> I'm using Google Presentation (cloud version of PowerPoint).</p>
	</div>

	<div class='qa'>
	<p class='question'><b>Q: Can I translate your posts to another language?</b></p>
	<p><b>A:</b> Yes and my pleasure! But please <a href="contact.html" target="_blank">email</a> me in advance and please keep the original post link on top (rather than in tiny font at the end, and yes I do see that case and that makes me feel sad).</p>
	</div>

	<div class='qa'>
	<p class='question'><b>Q: Do you update your old posts?</b></p>
	<p><b>A:</b> Yes, I update my old posts periodically. Everytime I would add an one-line update message in blue on top of that post, like:<br/><image src={{ '/assets/images/example-update.png' | relative_url }} style='width:75%'/>

	<div class='qa'>
	<p class='question'><b>Q: Hmmm ... I have papers on super relevant topics but you didn't include them?</b></p>
	<p><b>A:</b> As you may know, it is pretty challenging to do a comprehensive literature review given a big topic. There are so so many papers in the wild. With Google scholar and recursive citation search, I get to see quite a lot of papers but still not all of them. You are more than welcome to shoot me an email with pointers to interesting but missing papers. Cheers!
